# Java Data Structures and Set Operations

This repository contains Java programs for implementing basic data structures and performing set operations.

## Hashing

The `Hashing` class implements a simple hash table using linear probing and quadratic probing for collision resolution.

### Features
- Insertion of elements into the hash table
- Searching for elements in the hash table
- Displaying the hash table contents

### Usage
1. Compile the `Main.java` file.
2. Run the compiled `Main` class file.
3. Choose from the menu options to perform various operations like insertion, search, and display.

## Set Operations

The `SetOperation` class implements basic set operations such as union, intersection, and difference of two sets.

### Features
- Adding elements to sets A and B
- Deleting elements from sets A and B
- Displaying elements in sets A and B
- Searching for elements in sets A and B
- Computing the size of sets A and B
- Performing union, intersection, and difference operations on sets A and B
- Checking if set A is a subset of set B

### Usage
1. Compile the `SetOperation.java` file.
2. Run the compiled `SetOperation` class file.
3. Choose from the menu options to perform various set operations.
