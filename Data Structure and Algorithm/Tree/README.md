# Java Tree and Tree Operations

This repository contains Java programs for implementing various types of trees and performing operations on them.

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

The `BinaryTree` class implements a binary search tree (BST) along with various operations.

### Features
- Creation of BST by level
- Insertion of new nodes using an array
- Finding the number of nodes on the longest path from the root
- Finding the minimum data value in the tree
- Swapping left and right pointers of each node
- Searching for a value in the tree
- Traversing the tree in inorder, preorder, and postorder

### Usage
1. Compile the `Main.java` file.
2. Run the compiled `Main` class file.
3. Choose from the menu options to perform various operations on the binary search tree.

## Expression Tree

The `ExpressionTree` class implements an expression tree, where each internal node represents an operator and each leaf node represents an operand.

### Features
- Construction of the expression tree from a prefix expression
- Deletion of the expression tree
- Postorder traversal of the expression tree

### Usage
1. Compile the `ExpressionTree.java` file.
2. Run the compiled `ExpressionTree` class file.
3. Choose from the menu options to enter a prefix expression, delete the tree, or perform postorder traversal.

## Threaded Binary Tree (TBT)

The `Threaded` class implements a threaded binary tree (TBT), where threads are used to represent some null pointers.

### Features
- Creation of a threaded binary tree
- Inorder and preorder traversal of the threaded binary tree

### Usage
1. Compile the `Threaded.java` file.
2. Run the compiled `Threaded` class file.
3. Follow the prompts to create a threaded binary tree and choose from the menu options to display the tree in inorder or preorder traversal.
