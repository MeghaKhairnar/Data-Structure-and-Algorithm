# Java Programs README

## Description
This repository contains two Java programs:

1. **Hashing Program:** Implements a simple hash table using different collision resolution techniques like linear probing and quadratic probing.
2. **Set Operation Program:** Performs various operations on sets including adding elements, deleting elements, displaying elements, searching elements, calculating set sizes, finding unions, intersections, differences, and checking subsets.

## Usage

### Hashing Program
- Compile the program: `javac Main.java`
- Run the program: `java Main`
- Follow the menu prompts to perform operations like inserting elements, displaying the hash table, and searching for elements.

### Set Operation Program
- Compile the program: `javac SetOperation.java`
- Run the program: `java SetOperation`
- Follow the menu prompts to perform operations like adding elements to sets, deleting elements from sets, displaying elements in sets, searching for elements in sets, calculating set sizes, finding unions, intersections, differences, and checking subsets.
